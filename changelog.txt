v1.0.2
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for creating capsule
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for swaps
(now swaps work both ways and capsule works fine)
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed gnosis safe creation (DO)
- fixed daily auto reset
- fixed proxy usage
- changed wallet selection method (now queue fills correctly without repeating wallets)
- added wallet shuffling if first using database

Plans for future:
- tune up logs
- dig into failing to swap dai to eth (guess will need to give approve by signing message)
- also I think creating safe doesn't give points, maybe will investigate later
