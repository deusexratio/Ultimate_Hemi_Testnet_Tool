v1.0.2
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for creating capsule
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for swaps
(although still need to add sign message for approval, coming next version)
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed gnosis safe creation
- fixed daily auto reset
- fixed proxy usage
- changed wallet selection method (now queue fills correctly without repeating wallets)
- added wallet shuffling if first using database

Plans for future:
- tune up logs
- dig into failing to swap dai to eth (guess will need to give approve by signing message)
- also I think creating safe doesn't give points (despite raw input data seeming to be correct), maybe will investigate later

v.1.0.3
- TokenAmount class now requires to always input decimals (previously default was 18)
- added permit2 to swaps but still doesn't work properly
- added uniswap codec so you should recheck and install requirements

v1.0.4
- minor fixes

v1.0.5
- a lot of minor fixes
- added cycle to try out 4 of possible pool fees for swapping, but still I guess it doesn't make a big deal
