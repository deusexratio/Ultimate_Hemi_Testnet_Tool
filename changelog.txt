v1.0.2
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for creating capsule
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for swaps
(although you still need to add sign message for approval, coming next version)
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed gnosis safe creation
- fixed daily auto reset
- fixed proxy usage
- changed wallet selection method (now queue fills correctly without repeating wallets)
- added wallet shuffling if first using database

Plans for future:
- tune up logs
- dig into failing to swap dai to eth (guess will need to give approve by signing message)
- also I think creating safe doesn't give points (despite raw input data seeming to be correct), maybe will investigate later

v.1.0.3
- TokenAmount class now requires to always input decimals (previously default was 18)
- added permit2 to swaps but still doesn't work properly
- added uniswap codec so you should recheck and install requirements

v1.0.4
- minor fixes

v1.0.5
- a lot of minor fixes
- added cycle to try out 4 of possible pool fees for swapping, but still I guess it doesn't make a big deal

v1.0.6
- fixed swaps eth to token, added more tokens
- !!! now you need to create in root directory of the app '.env' file and put there:

ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = ''            ---REQUIRED
ARBISCAN_API_KEY = ''             ---not required, can leave empty
OPTIMISTIC_API_KEY = ''           ---not required, can leave empty
SEPOLIA_RPC = ''
ARBITRUM_RPC = ''
OPTIMISM_RPC = ''

RPCs are REQUIRED, you can put either public rpc, but it will eventually tell you that you are out of quota,
or you can get your own on infura.io or other provider

v1.1
- tuned up logs
- now daily swaps will be done 4 times to ensure that you get points (sometimes points are missed)
- now capsule will be created 3 times instead of 2 for same reason
- added @retry decorators in code (you will need to "pip install -r requirements.txt" again)

v1.2
- added new setting: minimal balance in hemi, I recommend keeping it 0.1+ eth
(you can just add 

'minimal_balance_hemi': 0.1,

to your settings.json)

- fixed asyncio tasks cancelling when closing app
- explorer API seem to work now, probably will add tx checking later on
