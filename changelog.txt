v1.0.2
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for creating capsule
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed approvals for swaps
(although you still need to add sign message for approval, coming next version)
- !!! CRITICAL !!! fixed gnosis safe creation
- fixed daily auto reset
- fixed proxy usage
- changed wallet selection method (now queue fills correctly without repeating wallets)
- added wallet shuffling if first using database

Plans for future:
- tune up logs
- dig into failing to swap dai to eth (guess will need to give approve by signing message)
- also I think creating safe doesn't give points (despite raw input data seeming to be correct), maybe will investigate later

v.1.0.3
- TokenAmount class now requires to always input decimals (previously default was 18)
- added permit2 to swaps but still doesn't work properly
- added uniswap codec so you should recheck and install requirements

v1.0.4
- minor fixes

v1.0.5
- a lot of minor fixes
- added cycle to try out 4 of possible pool fees for swapping, but still I guess it doesn't make a big deal

v1.0.6
- fixed swaps eth to token, added more tokens
- !!! now you need to create in root directory of the app '.env' file and put there:

ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = ''            ---REQUIRED
ARBISCAN_API_KEY = ''             ---not required, can leave empty
OPTIMISTIC_API_KEY = ''           ---not required, can leave empty
SEPOLIA_RPC = ''
ARBITRUM_RPC = ''
OPTIMISM_RPC = ''

RPCs are REQUIRED, you can put either public rpc, but it will eventually tell you that you are out of quota,
or you can get your own on infura.io or other provider

v1.1
- tuned up logs
- now daily swaps will be done 4 times to ensure that you get points (sometimes points are missed)
- now capsule will be created 3 times instead of 2 for same reason
- added @retry decorators in code (you will need to "pip install -r requirements.txt" again)

v1.2
- added new setting: minimal balance in hemi, I recommend keeping it 0.1+ eth
(you can just add 

'minimal_balance_hemi': 0.1,

to your settings.json)

- fixed asyncio tasks cancelling when closing app
- explorer API seem to work now, probably will add tx checking later on

~~~  v2  ~~~
- database structure updated, you will need to recreate database (added rechecked_txs_today column)

- added function for rechecking statuses of today transactions by explorer API.
every transaction is checked for failure right after getting receipt,
but sometimes chain reverts execution a bit later, so I came with a workaround:
now every transaction would be counted and redone if it was reverted throughout the day. 
recheck task activates automatically at 20 UTC and picks all wallets which rechecked_txs_today is False
when it finds at least 1 failed transaction it will mark rechecked_txs_today as True (so it won't be checked anymore today, resets at midnight together with activities)
and for every failed swap or capsule it will decrease by 1 amount of done for today

you also can call it manually through the main menu
but don't do it too early (morning or midday UTC) unless all your wallets are done for today

v2.1 
- small architecture rebuild
- added new table in database (you better recreate it) for checking txs in Hemi
- added usage of both V1 and V2 explorer APIs
as I see now, everything should work fine. only necessary transactions will be done prior to checking functions
future updates should be minor unless some critical bugs found

v2.1.1
- added waiting delays after bridging ETH to Hemi from Sepolia if wallet had less ETH Hemi than minimum stated in settings

v2.1.2
- minor fixes (roughly speed up in Sepolia if tx stuck)
- .env creates automatically at start
